### Script run at the end of each iteration of the mpdf-sev loop
### It calls a python script to determine if we've converged
### If it hasn't converged, overwrite submission scripts and dag
### splice and exit with 1, triggering a rerunning of the loop
### Options are written in by loop.py in job_sub
