Going to recoord ScintEffVel, then MultiPDF, and repeat

For ScintEffVel:
cd rat-tools_master/FitCoordination/ScinntEffectiveSpeed
use Template_Macro.mac with rat_submission/submitVelJobs

something like:
python submitVelJobs.py ../rat_root6/Template_Macro.mac /data/snoplus3/parkerw/ratSimulations/Apr8_5MeV_SEVRound1 -e /home/parkerw/Software/env-dev.sh -s /home/parkerw/Software/rat_submission/ -d /home/parkerw/Software/rat_root6/ -n 1


Update PlotRadialBias.C to use these files and do:
root -l PlotRadialBias.C
to make the gaussians, one for each velocity, all on one canvas. 


Update Utilities to use produced files and do:
python AnalyseData.py -i "labppo_2p2_scintillator"
to get the printed out table to put in the db file.


In Utilities, reverse meanBias[0] and speed in oneDimTGraph.SetPoint, also add: oneDimTGraph.SetPointError(count, 0, meanBias[1]). 
In AnalyseData.py change histograms = Utilities.ProducePlots() to histograms = Utilities.DrawPlot(). Comment out the next 3 lines and do:
python AnalyseData.py -i "labppo_2p2_scintillator"

Might have to double click the canvas once it's run to get the linear plot. Fit with tool panel on canvas.

You could then run simulation for the fitted speed to check it comes out consistent with 0 bias. Then run Plot1RadialBias.C to make the single gaussian.



To Do:
Update MultiPDF Template Macro to be 4m
